## Overview
Visual analytics report on the Mortdale property market (2006–2021), combining housing supply–demand signals, affordability, demographics, and dwelling structure to identify market shifts and constraints.

## Key Ideas
- Supply vs demand tracking using population and housing growth to assess balance over time.
- Affordability benchmarking using median household income vs median house/unit prices.
- Demographic & dwelling composition insights (workforce, dwelling mix, family structure) to interpret future demand.

## Executive Summary
Between 2006 and 2021, Mortdale’s population increased steadily (9,641 → 10,745). Housing supply broadly kept pace with population growth from 2011 onward, suggesting demand was largely met during the period.

Affordability deteriorated materially for houses: the house affordability index rose from **9.29 (2006)** to **14.52 (2021)**, while units remained comparatively more stable. The dwelling mix shifted slightly toward higher density: separate houses declined while semi-detached and apartments increased over time.

Labour market structure also changed: full-time employment declined (66.0% → 54.8%) and labour force participation dropped (95% → 87%), which may affect future purchasing power and housing demand.
